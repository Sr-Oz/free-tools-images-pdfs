# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! This project intentionally stays simple: plain HTML/CSS/JS,
no build step, no framework.

## Ground rules

- **Privacy is non-negotiable.** Nothing in a tool page may upload user files to a server or a
  third party. If a feature genuinely needs server-side processing, it doesn't belong in this repo
  as-is — open an issue to discuss it first.
- **No new build tooling** (bundlers, transpilers, package managers as a hard requirement) without
  a strong reason and prior discussion in an issue. The zero-build-step setup is a deliberate
  choice, not an oversight.
- **No accounts, no email gates, no watermarks.** Keep tools genuinely free and frictionless.

## Adding a new tool

1. Create a new folder at the repo root named after the tool's URL slug, e.g. `rotate-pdf/`, with
   an `index.html` inside (so it's served at `/rotate-pdf/`).
2. Copy the structure of an existing tool page (e.g. `compress-image/index.html` or
   `merge-pdf/index.html`) for the header/footer/layout markup.
3. Add the tool's logic as a new file in `assets/tools/your-tool.js`. Reuse the helpers in
   `assets/tools.js` (dropzone wiring, download triggering, byte formatting) and, for PDF tools,
   `assets/tools/pdf-common.js` (pdf-lib / pdf.js loading and rendering helpers).
4. Add a card for it on the homepage (`index.html`) in the appropriate section.
5. Add it to the tool table in `README.md`.
6. Test it locally by running a static server (see README) and exercising the tool in a browser —
   including drag-and-drop, at least one mobile viewport width, and an invalid/edge-case input.

## Reporting bugs / requesting tools

Please open a GitHub issue using the provided templates. Include your browser and OS, and steps to
reproduce for bugs.

## Code style

- No comments explaining *what* code does — only *why*, when it's genuinely non-obvious.
- Keep functions small and DRY through the shared helper files rather than a build-time bundler.
- Match the existing CSS variable-based theming (light/dark via `prefers-color-scheme`).
